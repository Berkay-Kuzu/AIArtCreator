Neon Apps Graduation Project

•	Developed the app with Dezgo API as a graduation project of Neon Apps Onboarding Camp from scratch. Users can send two words as inputs to the prompt and get related AI images from API. The app consists of Onboarding, Paywall, Home, Examples, Favorites, and Settings screens.

•	Made use of SnapKit for constraints and developed the app programmatically (without Storyboard).

•	Used RevenueCat and App Store Connect to provide subscriptions for weekly and yearly options.

•	Used Lottie animations to create pleasant UI and UX while fetching data from API.

•	Benefited from Hero library to provide smooth view controller transitions.

•	Utilized Core Data for users to save and delete created AI images to their local storage. Users can also regenerate the image by making a request to the API and save images to their photo library.
